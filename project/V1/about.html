<h1>Javaris Taylor
CIS 155 V1 Project</h1>
<p>I wasn't very sure what I was to be putting into this section for V1. 
I was simply following along and turning in the work but not truly understanding what I was applying.</p>
<h2>CIS 155 V2 Project May 14</h2>
<p>Now that I am moving on to V2 even though I am still slightly behind. 
    I believe that I have a better understanding of what I want to gain from this course.
For v2 I want to convert the page from a recipe book to an actual recipe for pancakes that I created.
As we move along in the course I hope to expand the idea.</p>
<p>An update on my progress, A few of the modules were head scratching for me. 
    I did a little research and thanks to w3 schools I got the extra help I needed. 
    Now my page is actually looking nice. I even got the recipes in and formatted it to look nicer.</p>
