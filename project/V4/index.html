            <p id="p1">You may not have had the privilege of living with someone with a gluten intolerance. Well I have and I'm here to tell you everything is made with wheat or some form of gluten. 
            I didn't know this, well not until my wife confessed to me her entire life she has been in pain and forced to eat what her body cannot digest. 
            The times when she would make attempts, it would become more apparent how difficult it is to maintain this diet.</p>
            <br />
            <p id="p2"> So that day we started a journey to cook meals that tasted great and didn't double her over! We picked our favorite foods and started theorizing recipies
            and ingredients we could combine to help her feel less trapped. To Find Her Gluten Freedom!</p>
