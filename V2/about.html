Javaris Taylor
CIS 155 V1 Project
I wasn't very sure what I was to be putting into this section for V1. 
I was simply following along and turning in the work but not truly understanding what I was applying.

<!-- Now that I am moving on to V2 even though I am still slightly behind. 
    I believe that I have a better understanding of what I want to gain from this course.
For v2 I want to convert the page from a recipe book to an actual recipe for pancakes that I created.
As we move along in the course I hope to expand the idea. -->
